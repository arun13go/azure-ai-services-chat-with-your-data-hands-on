    "Partitioning large documents into smaller chunks can help you stay under the maximum token input limits of embedding models. For example, the maximum length of input text for the [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings) embedding models is 8,191 tokens. Given that each token is around four characters of text for common OpenAI models, this maximum limit is equivalent to around 6,000 words of text. If you're using these models to generate embeddings, it's critical that the input text stays under the limit. Partitioning your content into chunks ensures that your data can be processed by the embedding models used to populate vector stores and text-to-vector query conversions.\n",

The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence (the UKHO) and Cleowent Harbour Commission (CHC) (together the Parties) have decided to enter a non-exclusive Agreement (this Agreement), for their mutual benefit in assuring the supply of hydrographic surveys, other data, and related information by CHC to the UKHO for inclusion in charts and other Products, and the supply of the UKHO's Products and related information to CHC for use in its work.</p>\\n<p>2. This Agreement formalises the exchanges between the Parties and seeks to encourage cooperation between them.</p>\\n<p>DEFINITIONS</p>\\n<p>3. Defined terms are set out at Appendix 1.</p>\\n<p>EXCHANGE OF MATERIAL AND PRODUCTS</p>\\n<p>4. In consideration of the following provisions, the Parties undertake to supply each other with material and Products as set out in Appendix 2.</p>\\n<h2>USE OF CLEOWENT HARBOUR COMMISSION MATERIAL BY THE UKHO AND ORGANISATIONS WITH WHICH THE UKHO IS COLLABORATING</h2>\\n<p>5. The UKHO will also be able to use and reproduce material protected by CHC intellectual property rights, without charge, in its products and services (and license the use and reproduction of such material by organisations with which the UKHO is collaborating, including other departments of the UK Government, Licensed Partners, joint venture companies established through the offices of the UKHO or Admiralty Holdings Limited and Third Parties who are providing a service to, or producing products for, UKHO, provided that such use or copying is confined solely to that which is strictly necessary for the provision of a service to, or the production of a product for, the UKHO), provided that due acknowledgement is given of the ownership of intellectual property rights in the material. All licence fees received by the UKHO from such organisations pertaining to the use of CHC data will be paid to CHC annually.</p>\\n<p>6. When Products containing reproductions made in accordance with paragraph 5 are designed primarily for navigation no royalties will be payable by the UKHO to CHC. When UKHO Products containing reproductions made in accordance with paragraph 5 are designed for non-navigational use then the UKHO will pay royalties to CHC. Such royalties will be calculated by multiplying the revenue received by the UKHO from sales of the Products by the proportion of the Products containing reproductions made in accordance with paragraph 5 and then by 12.5% and will be sent to CHC by the end of March each year. All licence fees received by the UKHO from the organisations with which the UKHO is collaborating pertaining to the sub- licensing of CHC intellectual property for use in non-navigational Products will also be sent to CHC by the end of March each year, together with a list of the licences issued.</p>\\n<p>7. The UKHO will also be entitled to authorise the reproduction of the UKHO's Products containing CHC intellectual property by other national hydrographic authorities in fulfilment of UKHO's international commitments.</p>\\n<p>USE OF UKHO MATERIAL BY CLEOWENT HARBOUR COMMISSION</p>\\n<p>8.

CHC grants permission to the UKHO to sub-license CHC intellectual property in material supplied to the UKHO and the UKHO's own Products, to organisations and individuals other than those referred to in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7, and to collect and forward any payments due to CHC. Such payments will be sent to CHC by the end of March each year, together with a list of the licences issued. Subject to the provisions in paragraph 11 of this Agreement, such licensing will be in accordance with the procedures and provisions that the UKHO applies to the licensing of its own intellectual property.</p>\\n<h2>PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>\\n<p>10. Use and reproduction of Products and other material by a Party not owning the intellectual property rights will be restricted to that covered by this Agreement and the Parties will take reasonable steps to ensure the protection of each other's intellectual property rights in such Products and other material.</p>\\n<h2>LIABILITY</h2>\\n<p>11.

The Parties agree that liability for Products and other material supplied by one Party to the other rests entirely with the supplying Party, except where a significant modification is made by the receiving Party, in which case liability for that modification rests with the receiving Party.</p>\\n<p>13. In the event of a claim being made by a third party, the Parties agree that before either Party settles or defends any claim they will apportion liability as between themselves on the basis of paragraph 12 above. Any damages awarded to a third party and payable by one of the Parties, or any settlement reached with a claimant by one of the Parties, will be paid in full by that Party. The other Party will then reimburse the paying Party its portion of the damages or settlement on the basis of the apportionment made in accordance with this paragraph 13.</p>\\n<p>14. Neither Party will have any liability to the other for any loss of business or profit or any indirect or consequential loss suffered by the other Party arising out of or in connection with any breach or non- performance of this Agreement regardless of the cause thereof.</p>\\n<p>15. Neither Party will have any liability to the other for any loss or damage suffered by the other arising as a consequence of an event of Force Majeure.</p>\\n<h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>\\n<p>16. The Agreement will come into effect on the date of the last signature and will supersede the agreement between the Parties signed on 26 September 2008. It will continue in operation until superseded or terminated according to the principles contained in paragraph 17 below. Both Parties' responsibilities under this Agreement will be suspended in the event of Force Majeure.

      "<p>1. The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence (the UKHO) and Cleowent Harbour Commission (CHC) (together the Parties) have decided to enter a non-exclusive Agreement (this Agreement), for their mutual benefit in assuring the supply of hydrographic surveys, other data, and related information by CHC to the UKHO for inclusion in charts and other Products, and the supply of the UKHO's Products and related information to CHC for use in its work.</p>\n",
      "<p>2. This Agreement formalises the exchanges between the Parties and seeks to encourage cooperation between them.</p>\n",
      "<p>DEFINITIONS</p>\n",
      "<p>3. Defined terms are set out at Appendix 1.</p>\n",

All licence fees received by the UKHO from such organisations pertaining to the use of CHC data will be paid to CHC annually.</p>\n",
      "<p>6. When Products containing reproductions made in accordance with paragraph 5 are designed primarily for navigation no royalties will be payable by the UKHO to CHC. When UKHO Products containing reproductions made in accordance with paragraph 5 are designed for non-navigational use then the UKHO will pay royalties to CHC. Such royalties will be calculated by multiplying the revenue received by the UKHO from sales of the Products by the proportion of the Products containing reproductions made in accordance with paragraph 5 and then by 12.5% and will be sent to CHC by the end of March each year. All licence fees received by the UKHO from the organisations with which the UKHO is collaborating pertaining to the sub- licensing of CHC intellectual property for use in non-navigational Products will also be sent to CHC by the end of March each year, together with a list of the licences issued.</p>\n",

Such payments will be sent to CHC by the end of March each year, together with a list of the licences issued.

Any damages awarded to a third party and payable by one of the Parties, or any settlement reached with a claimant by one of the Parties, will be paid in full by that Party. The other Party will then reimburse the paying Party its portion of the damages or settlement on the basis of the apportionment made in accordance with this paragraph 13.</p>\n",
